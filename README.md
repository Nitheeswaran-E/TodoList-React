Personal To-Do List Manager Programming Exercise


Problem Statement


Create a simple To-Do List Manager where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The user should also have the
option to view all tasks or filter them based on their completion status.

Functional Requirements

1. Enable users to add new tasks with a description and due date.
2. Allow tasks to be marked as 'completed'.
3. Provide an option to delete tasks.
4. Implement the ability to view tasks, either all at once or filtered by 'completed' or 'pending'.


Key Focus
1. Behavioral Pattern: Use the Memento Pattern to allow the user to undo or redo actions.
2. Creational Pattern: Use the Builder Pattern for constructing tasks with optional attributes like due date or tags.
3. OOP: Focus on encapsulation by keeping task data and methods together in a class.


Possible Inputs
 Add Task: "Buy groceries,
 Mark Completed: "Buy groceries"
 View Tasks: "Show all", "Show completed", "Show pending"
 
Possible Outputs

 Task List: Display the tasks along with their status, for example, "Buy groceries 
 
Evaluation

1. Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-organized, and does it adhere to best practices?
2. Functionality: Does the To-Do List Manager meet all functional requirements and offer a user-friendly experience?
3. Global Convention: Is the code written in a manner that's globally understandable and maintainable?
4. Gold Standards: Are logging and error handling gracefully implemented?
5. Code Walkthrough: Can the candidate convincingly explain their code, design choices, and any trade-offs they may have considered?
